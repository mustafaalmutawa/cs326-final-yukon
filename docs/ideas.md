Innovative Idea
Although many buy and sale apps already exist, this one will be tailored specifically to UMass students. This could mean that profiles allow you to select your major, or search can be filtered to just include old textbooks for certain UMass courses. This gives the idea a unique value to the UMass student body, and differentiates it from existing solutions. Also, this app can possibly be extended to other colleges or universities.

Important Components
All users will have the ability to search for and view added listings. Items can be filtered by category: furniture, clothing, etc. Additionally, users can find materials based on the UMass course that an item pertains to, like a used textbook. Users will also be able to filter the results by residential area. Only logged-in users can add a new listing, reserve an item, comment on listings, and send private messages. This means we would have a simple database component, and protected flows in our application. These are a broad set of features, and things like messaging will be added later, after basic buy/sell functionality is accomplished.
