## User Profile

The user profile page can either be viewed by the original user or the public (other users). Therefore, two slightly different pages are needed. Viewed by other users, the user proflie will show the user's information (name, photo, bio); number of sales, followers, and following; the user's evaluation (rating and feedback); and the users's listings. In contrast, when users view their personal pages, they will have more privileges. Specifically, they will have editing ability and the option to create a new listing.
